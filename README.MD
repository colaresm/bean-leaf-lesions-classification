# Classification of Bean Leaves ðŸŒ±ðŸ«˜

This project develops a web interface using Django, which classifies images of bean leaves to identify issues such as spots, rust, or determine if the leaf is healthy. The system integrates Mistral, a Large Language Model (LLM), which generates explanatory responses based on the classification results, providing a detailed diagnosis of the plant's condition. The project aims to facilitate early disease detection, offering an interactive and accessible solution for agricultural monitoring.
